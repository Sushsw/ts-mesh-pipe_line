Emissions,"Annual biogenic CO2emissions from large facilities across US states(source: EPA)Biogenic emissions, i.e., emissions from biological sources, are also a
        big contributor to climate change. Interestingly,FloridaandGeorgiaare the biggest
        emitters ofbiogenic
        greenhouse gases, thanks to the sugar and paper mills. Florida is also thebiggest producer of industrial Nitrous Oxide (NO2), thanks to
        the production of industrial chemicals inEscambia County.
        This is followed closely byAscension Parishin
        Louisiana. These two counties produce more NO2than most other states!",trillion triples,/tools/map#&sv=Annual_Emissions_CarbonDioxide_Biogenic&pc=0&pd=country/USA&ept=State,,/tools/map#&sv=Annual_Emissions_CarbonDioxide_Biogenic&pc=0&pd=country/USA&ept=State,,
